Did you know:
-Health Benefits of Popcorn
Popcorn? Yes it’s true, it’s not only delicious but also good for you.
A serving of popcorn a day has more antioxidants than fruit and vegetables. I’m not referring to the sugar-coated or buttery types, just the plain popcorn. Popcorn contains fibre and is the only snack that is 100% whole grain. It’s a great option to serve as a snack to children as healthy and fun to eat!
Some quick health benefits of Popcorn;
Low in fat, high in fibre
Rich in complex carbohydrates
Its antioxidants can help protect against cancers, heart diseases, and other illnesses that are caused by free radicals (cells that attack other healthy ones).
